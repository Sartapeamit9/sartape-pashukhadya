            A hospital contains one or more wards that house hospital beds for inpatients. It may also have acute services such as an <strong>emergency department, operating theatre, and intensive care unit</strong> <br />as well as a range of medical specialty departments. A well-equipped hospital may be classified as a trauma center. <br />we have other services such as a <strong>hospital pharmacy, radiology, pathology, and medical laboratories</strong> Some hospitals have outpatient departments such as behavioral health services, dentistry, and rehabilitation services

    <div id="Specialized :">
        <h2><mark>Specialized :</mark></h2>
        <p>Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. For example,<strong> Narayana Health's cardiac unit in Bangalore specialises in cardiac surgery </strong>and allows for a significantly greater number of patients. It has 3,000 beds and performs 3,000 in paediatric cardiac operations annually, the largest number in the world for such a facility.<br /> Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation, thus when the number of procedures increases, the hospital is able to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce its cost per procedure.[11] Each specialist may also become more efficient by working on one procedure like a production line.</p>

        <h2><mark>Emergency Services :</mark></h2>
        <p>The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. These facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury,<br /> and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as "accident & emergency") or trauma center to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. Larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. Some hospitals,<strong>especially in the United States and Canada, have their own ambulance service.</strong></p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated the development of virtual wards across the British NHS. Patients are managed at home, monitoring their own oxygen levels using an oxygen saturation probe if necessary and supported by telephone. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust managed around 1200 patients at home between March and June 2020 and planned to continue the system after COVID-19, initially for respiratory patients.[15] Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust started a COVID Oximetry@Home service in April 2020. This enables them to monitor more than 5000 patients a day in their own homes. The technology allows nurses, carers, or patients to record and monitor vital signs such as blood oxygen levels.</p>
